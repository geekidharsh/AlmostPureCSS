### A bunch of small css projects that I am working on as I am learning more and more about the awesome css properties along the way.

#### Some of the things worth laying out: 
- I add projects as i work on new things.
- Preprocessors and frameworks I use: sass, scss, bootstrap, Jade, haml.
- Advance transform, translate techniques
- Project's Github site: [almostpurecss](https://geekidharsh.github.io/AlmostPureCSS)
